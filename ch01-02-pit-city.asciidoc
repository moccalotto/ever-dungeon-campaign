The main entrance to the dungeon is an almost 700 meter deep cone shaped hole
with extremely steep sides made of Bedrock. At the bottom is a village called
Pit City where the tough guys hang out. In order to get into or out of the Put,
one must use a series of elevators. Near the bottom of the pit, in the sides of
the walls holes, which are the actual entrances to the Dungeon. In order to
access most entrances, one must take other elevators and/or do some climbing.

Pit City is a tent village that is the main staging area for entering the
Dungeon. The only main builds are an inn, a smithy, a few general stores and a
store for basic magical supplies. Other than that, there are some public
latrines and an area for tents. Pit City is sometimes attacked by Dungeon
Denizens, however, such attacks are almost always repelled by the people of Pit
City. For this reason, the land in Pit City is not taxed in any way. The
proprietor of the inn serves as the de facto mayor of Pit City, and the owner
of the smith is the second in command.
