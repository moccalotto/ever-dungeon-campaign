The bedrock on which the city stands is an extremely hard crystalline material
that seems living in many ways. It requires the highest level of magic to
pierce it. Furthermore it regenerates any damage done to it, often within hours
or days.

Most attempts to massively dig down has resulted in exposing the city directly
to very dangerous areas of the Dungeon.

There seem to be no clear correlation between where you dig down and which area
of the Dungeon is exposed. This is most likely due to the magical and chaotic
nature of the Dungeon.

When erecting walls and buildings, special care must be taken to make the
foundations of the building adhere to the bedrock. This is usually done with a
kind of glue made from slime- and tar monsters from the Dungeon.
