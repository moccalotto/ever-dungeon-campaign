There are no sales- or income taxes as such, but all land must be leased from
the City. The price of leasing a building varies greatly depending on the
price, location and condition of the building. The price also varies depending
on the purpose the lease. For instance, leasing a building with the purpose of
common housing is cheaper than leasing it to be used as a public house - at
least in certain areas. The city council can designate an area to be used for a
given purpose; if you lease a property to be used for anything other than that
purpose, your lease will be higher. The leaseholder can get a rebate if she
refurbishes the building. The city may also provide some financing for such
purposes.

The most expensive type of lease is the type where you lease a building with
the only purpose of living in it yourself.

The City also levies the use of cranes and elevators that transport people
and goods to/from the Dungeon.

The most complicated parts of the city monetary infrastructure is the guild
system. The guilds basically take a cut of every transaction, and they do what
they can to ensure that as many transactions as possible take place before
goods from the Dungeon reach the common citizens. Some amount of corruption has
infected this system. To make it even more complicated, the City does not have
to pay any guild taxes when it purchases goods and services from any guild member;
this means that there is quite a lot of paper work going on.
