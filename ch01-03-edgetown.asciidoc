The eastern edge of the City borders up against the Void, which is essentially
equivalent to outer space. It is as if the bedrock simply drops away. Anyone
who has gone over the edge, willingly or not, have never been seen again. Some
people claim to have seen lights, or even creatures flying out there, but this
has not been confirmed by reliable sources.

Since real estate is at a premium in the City, enterprising people have built a
scaffold on clinging onto the buildings and wall along the edge of the Void.
This scaffolding has over the years grown into a little town, called Edgetown.
This town is known for its high crime rate; the City Constables do not patrol it,
and they rarely venture out there, even during hot pursuit.
